# Low-Level-I-O-Procedures

A program that implements two macros for string processing and two procedures that utilize them to retrieve and print integers. Macro mGetString receives user input in ASCII representation, which proc ReadVal converts to a signed integer value. Proc WriteVal converts signed integers to thier ASCII representation before calling macro mDisplayString to print them. The functionality of the macros and procedures is tested in the main program, which prompts the user to enter 10 integers that will fit in a 32-bit register before printing a list of the integers, the total sum, and the truncated average. Data validation is done by ReadVal.
